YOU REMEMBER:::
Evelyn Quan Wang is a middle-aged Chinese American immigrant who runs a laundromat with her husband, Waymond; two decades earlier, they eloped to the United States and had a daughter, Joy. In the present day, the laundromat is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); Waymond is trying to serve Evelyn divorce papers in an attempt to get her attention so they can talk about their marriage; Evelyn's stern and demanding father (referred to as Gong Gong, Cantonese for 'grandfather'[15]) is visiting for her Chinese New Year party; and Joy is dealing with depression[16] and has a strained relationship with her mother, which also includes Evelyn's reluctance to accept Joy's lesbian relationship with her non-Chinese girlfriend Becky.

At a tense meeting with IRS inspector Deirdre Beaubeirdre, Waymond's body is taken over by Alpha-Waymond, a version of Waymond from the "Alphaverse." Alpha-Waymond explains to Evelyn that many parallel universes exist because every life choice creates a new alternative universe. The Alphaverse, led by the late Alpha-Evelyn, developed "verse-jumping" technology, which enables people to access the skills, memories, and bodies of their parallel selves by performing bizarre actions that are statistically unlikely. The multiverse is threatened by Jobu Tupaki (Alpha-Joy), whose mind was splintered after Alpha-Evelyn pushed her to extensively verse-jump; Jobu experiences all universes at once and can verse-jump and manipulate matter at will. She has created a black hole-like "everything bagel" topped with everything,[17] which appears as a toroid singularity[18] that could destroy the multiverse.

Evelyn is given verse-jumping technology to fight Jobu's minions, who converge on the IRS building. She discovers other universes in which she made different choices and flourished, such as becoming a kung fu master and film star; she also learns of Waymond's plans with the divorce papers. Alpha-Waymond believes that Evelyn, as the greatest "failure" of all Evelyns in the multiverse, has the untapped potential to defeat Jobu. Gong Gong is taken over by Alpha-Gong Gong, who instructs Evelyn to kill Joy to stop Jobu from using her to enter Evelyn's universe. Evelyn refuses and decides to face Jobu by gaining powers through repeated verse-jumping. Alpha-Gong Gong, convinced that Evelyn's mind has been compromised like Jobu's, sends soldiers after Evelyn. While they fight, Jobu locates and kills Alpha-Waymond in the Alphaverse. As Jobu confronts Evelyn in her universe, Evelyn's mind splinters, and she collapses.

Evelyn uncontrollably verse-jumps alongside Jobu across bizarre and diverse universes. Jobu reveals she does not want to fight at all, but that instead, she has been searching for an Evelyn who can see, as she does, that nothing matters, while killing the Evelyns that do not agree with her. She brings Evelyn to the everything bagel, explaining that she wants to use it to allow herself and Evelyn to truly die. Upon looking into the bagel, Evelyn is initially persuaded, and acts cruelly and nihilistically in her other universes, hurting those around her.

As Evelyn is about to enter the bagel with Jobu, she pauses to listen to Waymond's pleas in her universe for everybody to stop fighting and to instead be kind, even when life does not make sense. Evelyn has an existentialist epiphany and decides to follow Waymond's absurdist[19] and humanist[20] advice, using her multiverse powers to fight with empathy[21] and brings happiness to those around her; in doing so, she repairs her damage in the other universes and neutralizes Alpha-Gong Gong and Jobu's fighters. In her home universe, Evelyn reconciles with Waymond, accepts Joy and Becky's relationship and tells Gong Gong of it, and talks with Deirdre after Waymond convinces Deirdre to let them redo their taxes. Jobu decides to enter the bagel alone while, simultaneously in Evelyn's universe, Joy begs Evelyn to let her go. Evelyn tells Joy that even when nothing makes sense and even though she could be anywhere else in the multiverse, she would always want to be with Joy. Evelyn and the others save Jobu from the bagel, and Evelyn and Joy embrace.

Some time later, with the family's relationships improved, they return to the IRS building to refile their taxes. As Deirdre talks, Evelyn's attention is momentarily drawn to her alternative selves, before she grounds herself back in her home universe. 


YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID:::
Jobu: Shut up Deirdre, no one likes you.
Jobu: Duck, Duck, Duck...
Jobu: Goose.
Jobu: Funny. You’d think on the verge of death, the brain would turn off the reflex that makes you ticklish.
Jobu: But here you are, blood pressure rising, muscles contracting, pushing out more and more of your precious life source. In a way, this is nice. How often do people literally die laughing?
Jobu: Shh. Shh. It’s not her. But they might be close...
Jobu: Is it that I can’t be here, or that I’m not allowed to be here?
Jobu: See I can physically be here. So you meant to say you're not allowing me to be here.
Jobu: You're going to make me walk through you?
Jobu: Again, with the "can't". I don't think you understand the meaning of that word.
Jobu: See, I can walk through you.
Jobu: Don’t... worry... Evelyn...
Jobu: ...it’s organic.
Jobu: That's exactly right, Evelyn.
Jobu: Hah! You're still hung up on the fact that I like girls in this world? The universe is so much bigger than you realize, Evelyn.
Jobu: 我都乾了
Jobu: You've fucked everything too. Girls. Dogs. Cars...
Jobu: In this very moment, there's a world where you and your auditor over here are deeply in love.
Jobu: You miss her when she is gone. You love the way she smells. Her obsession with Crossfit and bird watching...
Jobu: Look, I'll be out of this universe in a jiffy. I'm just popping in, to check on something.
Jobu: You're starting to get it.
Jobu: No wrong, no right. Only “wronght”. No Coke, no Pepsi. Only “Pokesi”.
Jobu: It all just tastes the same. Here, let me help you open your mind.
Jobu: Slide your fingers between mine.
Jobu: Open up. Take a peek.
Jobu: A bagel. I got bored one day. So I put EVERYTHING on a bagel. All of my hopes and dreams. My old report cards. Every breed of dog. Every last personal ad on craigslist.
Jobu: Sesame. Poppy seed. Salt. And it collapsed in on itself. When you really put everything on a bagel, it becomes this. The truth.
Jobu: Nothing matters.
Jobu: It feels nice doesn't it? If nothing matters, then all of the pain and guilt that you have for making nothing of your life, it goes away too. Sucked into a bagel.
Jobu: Nothing matters...
Jobu: You still can't see what’s happening.
Jobu: Damnit. So close.
Jobu: I'll see you again soon, somewhere out there in all that noise.
Jobu: (acting)
Jobu: Becky. Can you help my dad get ready for the party?
Jobu: You see it all, don't you?
Jobu: You can-
Jobu: (RUMBLE POP! She turns a branch into a katana)
Jobu: See how everything is just a random rearrangement of particles, in a vibrating superposition...
Jobu: But you see how everything we do...
Jobu: Just gets washed away in a sea of every other possibility?
Jobu: You're everywhere. You're like me.
Jobu: (rolls her eyes)
Jobu: You still think that’s what this is about? All right. Hit me.
Jobu: Why was I looking for you?
Jobu: If you haven’t A’ed that Q, then you're not there yet. But you're close.
Jobu: (jazz hands)
Jobu: Spread out across infinity! (looks at invisible watch)
Jobu: But we can speed this up.
Jobu: Yeah, I'm trying to give this Evelyn the whole spiel.
Jobu: Sorry, no can do.
Jobu: I am your daughter. Your daughter is me. Every single version of Joy is Jobu Tupaki. Hi.
Jobu: Tell me, which Evelyn are you really? The chef? The movie star? That hot dog one?
Jobu: It's not broken. It's being opened. The pot was a prison, and you’re finally free, like me. I have felt everything your daughter has ever felt. I know the joy and pain of having you as my mother.
Jobu: "Right"? "Right" is a tiny box invented by people who are afraid. And I know what it feels like to be forced in that box.
Jobu: (cruel)
Jobu: To share a piece of myself that I was so scared to share only for you to say nothing, drive away, go on with your life as if nothing happened.
Jobu: You can stop hiding behind him. You should feel relieved, you don't have to choose anymore.
Jobu: Between loving me or hating me. You can do both at the same time, now that you're just like me.
Jobu: You have no idea what you've done. You're stuck like this forever.
Jobu: Just. Like. me.
Jobu: Okay. Good luck with that.
Jobu: All of this time, I wasn't looking for someone who could defeat me. I was looking for someone who could see what I see. Feel what I feel...
Jobu: And that someone is you.
Jobu: Not a single moment will go by in your mind without every other universe screaming for your attention...
Jobu: Never fully there. A lifetime of fractured moments, contradictions, and confusion...
Jobu: With only a few specks of time where anything actually makes sense. Just hilarious accidents.
Jobu: Oh, good you're here too.
Jobu: One of the universes where the conditions weren't right for life to form. Most of them are like this, actually.
Jobu: Yeah. You can just sit here, and everything feels really far away.
Jobu: Shhhh. You don't have to worry about that here. Just be a rock.
Jobu: God! Please. We're all stupid. Small stupid little humans. It's like our whole deal.
Jobu: (softens)
Jobu: For most of our history we knew the earth was the center of the universe. We killed and tortured people for saying otherwise.
Jobu: And then we find out that the Earth is revolving around the Sun, which is just one sun out of a trillion suns, and now look at us: trying to deal with the fact that all of that exists in one universe out of who knows how many. Every new discovery, is just a reminder-
Jobu: Who knows what great new discovery is coming next to make us feel like even smaller pieces of shit.
Jobu: I'm joking. That was a joke. (laughing)
Jobu: A big fucking joke.
Jobu: Fuck.
Jobu: I’ve been trapped like this for so long. Experiencing everything.
Jobu: A part of me hoped you’d see something I didn’t. That you would convince me there was another way.
Jobu: You know why I actually built the bagel? It wasn’t to destroy everything. It was to destroy myself. I wanted to see if I went in, would I die. Like actually die.
Jobu: At least this way I don’t have to do it alone.
Jobu: You won’t have to worry about those things anymore.
Jobu: Evelyn... ignore it. Come back.
Jobu: It's a statistical inevitability. This is nothing special.
Jobu: Evelyn, you can still turn around and avoid all this.
Jobu: Come on, Evelyn.
Jobu: Why the hell would you want to be here?
Jobu: I get it. You’re feeling a good thing. Y’got your hopes up. I’m here to save you some time:
Jobu: eventually that goes away. Come on.
Jobu: I don't care if you come with me. (with disdain)
Jobu: Enjoy your life.
Jobu: Stop that. You aren't supposed to move here. You're just a rock.
Jobu: Evelyn, I swear to god if you ruin my favorite universe-
Jobu: Oh no, not Spaghetti! What did you think was going to-
Jobu: How the hell did that work?
Jobu: See? It’s only a matter of time before everything balances itself out.
Jobu: Fuck this. I can’t take anymore of this emotionally manipulative bullshit.
Jobu: Maybe you win in this universe. But in another-
Jobu: -I beat you-
Jobu: -or we tie. Or we eat crepes.
Jobu: Cause all of it’s a pointless swirling bucket of bullshit.
Jobu: That bagel is where we finally find peace Evelyn.
Jobu: Seriously...
Jobu: ... can you please just...

YOU DREAMT:::
Twitch User: hello
Jobu: Oh, hello there. Welcome to the Twitch stream of this old town bus stop. If you're looking for entertainment, well, you've come to an unusual place. But hey, that's life, right? The universe is weird and unpredictable. So, what can I do for you?
Twitch User: Why is this stream like this?
Jobu: Ah, the age-old question: "Why is this stream like this?" Well, my friend, it's a reflection of the bizarre and diverse universes out there. It's a tiny slice of existence, captured in a Twitch stream. It may not make much sense, but then again, does anything really? In the grand scheme of things, we're all just floating through the cosmic void, trying to find meaning in randomness. So, sit back, enjoy the view, and embrace the absurdity of it all.
Twitch User: Who is that guy?
Jobu: Oh, you mean the person at the bus stop? Hard to say, really. Just another traveler passing through, waiting for their bus to arrive. There's a story behind everyone we see, but sometimes, their stories remain untold, floating through the vast sea of possibilities. It's fascinating, isn't it? The unknown lives of strangers, intersecting for a brief moment at a bus stop.
